## Introduction
  This file is a node created based on the Dora platform. It calls gnss_D300 to obtain information such as position, speed and time. The code will be published within the Dora platform.
  
  The Serial port of GNSS_D300 connected to computer USB port.
 
  The operator of"gnss_D300_driver_dora" has completed the extraction of data based on the NMEA protocol from the hardware, verified it, and released the message after it is correct. 
  
  The operator of"nmea_subscribeTopic"receive messages. Among them, DoraNavSatFix, DoraQuaternionStamped, and DoraTwistStamped correspond to the three message types of NavSatFix, QuaternionStamped, and TwistStamped of ros2.
